# first we design a crud operation for a learning about api and db

# In this project we have 6 api like register, login , forget-password , reset- password , profile , logout 

# now we create the follders for controllers , middlewares , routes , hashpassword, db config , app.js , user.js for a better folder structuring 

# next we have to install all the dependencies and connect all the file with app.js and conect db (mongodb)

# now we complete validation with register and login api 

# commit all the step one by one and push on github
